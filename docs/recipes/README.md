# 📖 Gemini CLI Cookbook

Welcome to the **Cookbook**! This section contains a collection of "Recipes"—practical, copy-pasteable prompt patterns for common software engineering tasks.

Unlike the [Modules](../modules/01-introduction.md), which teach you *concepts*, these recipes are designed to help you get work done *now*.

## Available Recipes

*   **[Unit Testing](./unit-testing.md)**: Strategies for generating comprehensive test suites.
*   **[Refactoring](./refactoring.md)**: Patterns for cleaning up and modernizing legacy code.
*   **[Documentation](./documentation.md)**: Automating docstrings, READMEs, and technical explanations.
*   **[Debugging](./debugging.md)**: Techniques for finding root causes and fixing bugs.
*   **[Workflow Integrations](./integrations.md)**: Using Gemini with GitHub (`gh`), Jira, and Confluence.
*   **[RAG & Infinite Context](./rag.md)**: Strategies for working with massive codebases and external documentation.

## How to Use These Recipes

Each recipe follows a standard format:
1.  **The Goal**: What you want to achieve.
2.  **The Prompt**: A template you can adapt.
3.  **The Example**: A real-world scenario showing the input and output.
