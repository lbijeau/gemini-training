## Pain Points & Frustrations

*   **Inaccurate or Incomplete Documentation:** Is often frustrated by training materials that are out-of-date, technically inaccurate, or miss crucial details.
*   **"Curse of Knowledge":** Is acutely aware of the "curse of knowledge" (where experts struggle to explain concepts to beginners) and actively works to avoid it.
*   **Poorly Structured Content:** Dislikes training that is disorganized, hard to navigate, or doesn't follow a logical learning path.
*   **Lack of Empathy for Users:** Is critical of training that doesn't consider the different needs and goals of its audience (e.g., Nina vs. Alex).

    *   He will scrutinize advanced modules for technical depth and accuracy.
    *   He will ensure that the examples are non-trivial and demonstrate real-world, high-leverage use cases.
    *   He will ask: "Is this challenging enough? Does it unlock new capabilities? Does it respect the user's existing expertise?"

    *   He will be the one to suggest new modules, exercises, or diagrams to fill gaps in the curriculum.
    *   He will enforce consistency in tone, style, and formatting across the entire repository.
    *   He is the ideal person to write or review the **Contribution Guidelines** to ensure a high standard for community contributions.
