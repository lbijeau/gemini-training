# Getting Started with Gemini CLI

Welcome to Gemini CLI! This guide will help you set up your environment and perform your first interaction with the code assistant.

## 1. Introduction to Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI is a powerful command-line interface that allows you to interact with the Gemini code assistant to generate, refactor, and analyze code. It's designed to streamline your development workflow by providing AI-powered assistance directly in your terminal.

## 2. Installation and Setup

### Prerequisites

Before installing Gemini CLI, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.8+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-training.git
    cd gemini-training
    ```
2.  **Install Gemini CLI (if not already installed):**
    ```bash
    pip install gemini-cli # Replace with actual installation command
    ```
3.  **Configure your API Key:**
    Follow the official Gemini CLI documentation to set up your API key. This typically involves setting an environment variable or configuring a `~/.gemini/config.json` file. (Provide a link to actual docs when available).

## 3. First Interaction: "Hello, World!" Function

Let's start with a simple task: asking Gemini to write a "Hello, World!" function in Python.

1.  **Create a new file** in the `practice/` directory:
    ```bash
    touch practice/hello_world_gemini.py
    ```
2.  **Run Gemini CLI** with a prompt to generate the function. (This command is illustrative and depends on the actual Gemini CLI usage).
    ```bash
    gemini generate --output practice/hello_world_gemini.py --prompt "write a python function named hello_world that prints 'Hello, Gemini!'"
    ```
    *Note: The exact command syntax may vary based on your Gemini CLI installation. This is a hypothetical example.*

3.  **Inspect the generated code:**
    Open `practice/hello_world_gemini.py` to see the function Gemini generated.

4.  **Execute the code:**
    ```bash
    python practice/hello_world_gemini.py
    ```
    You should see "Hello, Gemini!" printed to your console.
