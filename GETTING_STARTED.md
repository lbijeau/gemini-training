# Getting Started with Gemini CLI

Welcome to Gemini CLI! This guide will help you set up your environment and perform your first interaction with the code assistant.

## 1. Introduction to Gemini CLI

The Gemini CLI is a powerful command-line interface that allows you to interact with the Gemini code assistant to generate, refactor, and analyze code. It's designed to streamline your development workflow by providing AI-powered assistance directly in your terminal.

## 2. Installation and Setup

If you're new to command-line tools or need a refresher on basic terminal commands used in these exercises, please refer to our **[Prerequisites for Gemini Training](docs/support/prerequisites.md)** document.

### Prerequisites

Before installing Gemini CLI, ensure you have the following installed:

*   **Python 3.8+**: [Download Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
*   **pip**: Python's package installer (usually comes with Python).
*   **git**: [Download Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

### Installation Steps

1.  **Clone this repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/gemini-training.git
    cd gemini-training
    ```
2.  **Install Gemini CLI:**
    Ensure the `gemini` command line tool is installed and available in your system PATH.
    *   *Note: Installation methods vary by distribution (e.g., `npm`, `pip`, `brew`, or binary download). Please refer to the official documentation for your specific version of the Gemini CLI.*

3.  **Configure your API Key:**
    Set up your authentication as required by your installation (typically by setting an environment variable like `GEMINI_API_KEY` or `GOOGLE_API_KEY`).

4.  **Verify Installation:**
    Check that the tool is ready:
    ```bash
    gemini --help
    ```

## 3. First Interaction: "Hello, World!" Function

Let's start with a simple task: asking Gemini to write a "Hello, World!" function in Python.

1.  **Create a new file** in the `practice/` directory:
    ```bash
    touch practice/hello_world_gemini.py
    ```
2.  **Run Gemini CLI** with a prompt to generate the function.
    ```bash
    gemini 'Write a Python function named `hello_world` that prints "Hello, Gemini!". Create it in a new file at `practice/hello_world_gemini.py`.'
    ```

3.  **Inspect the generated code:**
    Open `practice/hello_world_gemini.py` to see the function Gemini generated.

4.  **Execute the code:**
    ```bash
    python practice/hello_world_gemini.py
    ```
    You should see "Hello, Gemini!" printed to your console.
